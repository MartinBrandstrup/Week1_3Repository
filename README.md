# Week1_3Repository
 

The days are marked with dates, so 03_24 is for tuesday and so on. The project called demo is for the code-along and other excercises during class and can be ignored
The assignments inside the individual projects are not marked other than directed during the actual assignment. For a bit more clarity:

- 03_24_comps_and_props
is sorted into 3 App.js files. All assignments except 3.e is completed, but some with a few peculiarities that I have not quite figured out yet; all explained in comments
